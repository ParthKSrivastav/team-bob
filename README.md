Meet Our Team: UK Finals Participants

We are excited to introduce our team members participating in the UK finals: Parth Srivastav, Raphael Peduru, and Jai Kumar Kairamakonda. All three of us are Year 9 students, aged 14, 13, and 13, respectively.

About Us
Parth Srivastav
Parth is the only team member with prior experience in such competitions. He has participated in the World Robotics Olympiad (WRO) twice before, in the junior and elementary categories. Parth is a Year 9 student at Maiden Erlegh School. He enjoys playing video games and working on this competition.

Raphael Peduru
Raphael is an ace student at Maiden Erlegh School with a passion for drama. He has been involved in numerous plays. In his free time, Raphael enjoys acting and playing the piano.

Jai Kumar Kairamakonda
Jai is a talented Python coder with a keen interest in learning and self-improvement, both mentally and physically. He loves reading books and coding in Python during his free time.

Our Project
How It Works
Our project involves:
electrical wiring,
coding,
circuit architecture.

Circuit Architecture
Our WRO robot uses the Raspberry Pi 4B as the motherboard, offering the same capabilities as some laptops but in a much smaller form factor. The Raspberry Pi ensures a snappy response time. We use the Hailege motor controller L298N to communicate with our motors rapidly, minimizing input delay and allowing quick reactions to sensor data.

Sensors
Our robot is equipped with five sensors to provide a comprehensive view of its surroundings. For avoiding frontal collisions, we use a TF Luna  a LIDAR sensor, which react extremely quickly to any object in front. These sensors can detect objects up to 8 meters ahead in brightly lit areas and 2.5 meters in darker areas. The combination of the TF Luna’s quick response and the L298N’s rapid reaction time makes frontal collisions nearly impossible. Additionally, we have two ultrasonic sensors on the sides to detect obstacles.

Robot body
For our robot's body we have used a RC truck. Which we have stripped of all the remote control parts and put raspberry pi 4b with a 10000mah power bank. To fit the TF luna we have cut 2 holes in the cabin which lets all the cables through and for the ultra sonic sensors we have tapped them to the side . Bringing the cable from above
